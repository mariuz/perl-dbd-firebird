A test suite for DBD drivers
============================

This is an attempt to write a test suite for DBD drivers. In short I
took Alligator Descarte's test script for mSQL, isolated database
specific parts and wrote something around. I'd be glad, if other
driver authors would take it, adapt the DBMS specific file (lib.pl)
to their drivers. IMO this would enhance the stability of DBI a
lot.


What's currently included?
==========================

The test suite consists of a lot of files, currently these are:

  lib.pl	   the core of the test suite, being included by any
                   test before doing anything; in short it defines
                   variables $mdriver and $dbdriver, includes
	           $mdriver.mtest and $dbdriver.dbtest and defines
                   some global functions used within any test.

  skeleton.test    A skeleton file for writing new tests. Basically you
		   take this file and at a given point you include your
		   tests. This file is described in detail below.

  README           You are reading this. :-)

  00base.t	   This is essentially the base.t from DBD::Oracle. It
		   checks whether the driver may be installed.

  10dsnlist.t      This script checks $dbh->data_sources. I missed the
		   possibility of passing data source attributes like
		   host and port. :-(

  10listtables.t   This is a DBMS specific test: It lists the tables of
		   a given dsn.

  20createdrop.t   Guess what this does? :-) Yes, it creates a table and
		   drops it.

  30insertfetch.t  Inserts a row into a table and retreives it

  40blobs.t        Likewise, but using blobs. This is a check for
		   $dbh->quote and inserting and retreiving binary data.

  40listfields.t   Checks the attributes of a statement handle, currently
		   NUM_OF_FIELDS, NAME and NULLABLE.

  40nulls.t        Checks working with NULLS.

  40update.t       Checks the UPDATE statement.

  40bindparam.t    Checks the bind_col() method and the internal
                   function dbd_ph_bind().

  50chopblanks.t   Checks the "ChopBlanks" attribute.

  50commit.t       Checks commit, rollback and the "AutoCommit" attribute.

  mysql.mtest      These files are used for setting up the DBMS specific
  mysql.dbtest     part for the 'mysql' database with constants (dsn
	           definitions, user, password for running tests), a
	           possibility to create a table from a somewhat abstract
	           table description, and a function for listing tables.
	           Additionally some functions for supporting test script
	           are included. These files are described in detail below.

  mSQL.mtest       Likewise for mSQL.
  mSQL.dbtest

  pNET.mtest       Likewise for pNET.
  pNET.dbtest

  Ingres.mtest     Likewise for Ingres.
  Ingres.dbtest

  ODBC.mtest       Likewise for ODBC.
  ODBC.dbtest


How do I use the test suite for my driver?
==========================================

Basically you create scripts "mydriver.mtest" and "mydriver.dbtest",
modify them for your needs and insert the name "mydriver" in "lib.pl".
There should be no need for modifying the test files themselves, except
for executing immediately after including lib.pl, if a test isn't well
suited for your driver. (See mSQL and t/40blobs.t for an example.)

In particular you should

  - set the variable $mdriver and $dbdriver to your driver name;
    examples are

	$mdriver = $dbdriver = 'mysql';  or
	$mdriver = $dbdriver = 'mSQL';

    (Using different values is only required for DBD::pNET where one
    has to distinguish between the module driver ($mdriver = 'pNET')
    and the database driver ($dbdriver).

    Ignore $test_dsn, $test_user and $test_password here, set this in
    "mydriver.dbtest".

  - set the dsn, user name and password for test purposes in
    "mydriver.dbtest", if the defaults aren't good for you. The
    default is

	$::test_dsn      = $ENV{'DBI_DSN'}   ||  "DBI::$::driver:test";
	$::test_user     = $ENV{'DBI_USER'}  ||  "";
	$::test_password = $ENV{'DBI_PASS'}  ||  "";

  - create a function ListTables() in "mydriver.mtest" (This could
    be in "mydriver.dbtest" as soon as there is a similar functionality
    in DBI itself.): Given a database handle dbh, return a list of table
    names present in the corresponding database; for example in mysql
    this is done as follows:

	if (!defined(@tables = $dbh->func('_ListTables'))  ||
	    $dbh->errstr) {
	    return undef;
	} else {
	    return tables;
        }

    See mysql.mtest for an exaple.

  - create a function AnsiTypeToDb() in "mydriver.dbtest":
    Given a type string like "char", "integer" or "blob" and a size,
    return a string that is suitable for use in CREATE statements.
    For example "char" and "64" could return "char(64)", sizes can
    currently be ignored for "integer". Currently "integer", "char"
    and "blob" are valid input types. In mysql.dbtest this is implemented
    as follows:

	if ((lc $type) eq 'blob') {
	    if ($size >= 1 << 16) {
		$ret = 'MEDIUMBLOB';
	    } else {
		$ret = 'BLOB';
	    }
	} elsif ((lc $type) eq 'int'  ||  (lc $type) eq 'integer') {
	    $ret = uc $type;
	} elsif ((lc $type) eq 'char') {
	    $ret = "CHAR($size)";
	} else {
	    warn "Unknown type $type\n";
	    $ret = $type;
	}

    See mysql.dbtest for an example.
  
  - create a function TableDefinition() in "mydriver.dbtest": Given a
    table name and a list of column attributes like

	TableDefinition("tablename",
			[ "id", "INTEGER", 4, $COL_KEY ],
			[ "name", "CHAR",  64, 0 ],
			[ "email", "CHAR", 64, $COL_NULLABLE ]),

    return a string for use in a CREATE statement, like

	CREATE TABLE tablename (
		id INTEGER NOT NULL,
		name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
		email VARCHAR(64),
		PRIMARY KEY(id))

    The function need not know about foreign keys, secondary keys or other
    extended possibilities. If AnsiTypeToDb works and your driver conforms
    to Ansi SQL, the example from mysql.dbtest should be fine for you.

  - create a function HaveTransactians() that returns TRUE, if your
    database supports transactions and FALSE otherwise

  - create a function IsNull(): Given a column name, return an SQL
    expression that checks whether the column is NULL, for example

        sub IsNull ($) {
            my($col) = @_;
            "$col = NULL"; # or "$col IS NULL"
        }

That's it! Try a "make test". :-)


How do I use the test suite for my driver?
==========================================

Let's take a look at skeleton.test:

The first thing you notice is that the file "lib.pl" is included by executing
a "do". Leave this as it is, but note the last lines:

    if ($mdriver eq 'whatever') {
        print "1..0\n";
        exit 0;
    }

This is the place where to stop the test, if it isn't suitable for a certain
driver or for your driver only by modifying the condition. The next thing
to notice is

    #
    #   Main loop; leave this untouched, put tests after creating
    #   the new table.
    #
    while (Testing()) {

You should know, that skeleton.test will run this loop twice. The
first time no test is executed, only the tests are counted, so that
a valid input string for Test::Harness can be printed, like

	1..15

to indicate that 15 tests will follow.

The second pass will indeed run the tests. The Testing() function has
extended possibilities which I won't describe here, for building groups
of tests (for example it probably doesn´t make sense to execute a
test if even the connect failed).

The next thing we notice is a first test: Connecting to the DBMS.

    #
    #   Connect to the database
    Test($state or ($dbh = DBI->connect($test_dsn, $test_user,
					$test_password)),
	 undef,
	 "Attempting to connect.\n");
	   or ErrMsgF("Cannot connect: Error %s.\n\n"
		      . "Make sure, your database server is up and running.\n"
		      . "Check that '$test_dsn' references a valid database"
		      . " name.\nDBI error message: $DBI::errstr");

Things you should note here:

  - The Test() function will be called always, so that lib.pl has
    control over what happens; in particular the number of tests will
    be counted.
  - The test will only be executed if $state == 0 (not vice versa!);
    this ensures that your tests won't be executed twice, although
    the loop will be repeated.
  - a boolean value is passed to the function Test() as the first
    argument. This function will print a "ok $numTests" or a "not
    ok $numTests" for TRUE or FALSE.
  - the second argument is 'undef'; ignore this for now.
  - the third argument is a message that will be printed before
    executing the test, if $verbose=1. This is for use in large
    test scripts where you would otherwise leave the connection
    between test output ("315 ok, 316 ok, 317 not ok, ...") and
    test script.
  - if Test() fails a long error message is printed by using the
    function ErrMsgF. This function receives printf-style input.

Now a second test: We let lib.pl detect the name for a new table
that should be created, so that we may work in it.

    #
    #   Find a possible new table name
    #
    Test($state or ($def = TableDefinition($table,
					   ["id",   "INTEGER",  4, 0],
					   ["name", "CHAR",    64, 0]),
		    $dbh->do($def)))
	   or ErrMsgF("Cannot create table: Error %s.\n",
		      $dbh->errstr);

As a third test we create the database. Note the use of the
TableDefinition() function.

    #
    #   Create a new table; EDIT THIS!
    #
    Test($state or ($def = TableDefinition($table,
					   ["id",   "INTEGER",  4, 0],
					   ["name", "CHAR",    64, 0]),
		    $dbh->do($def)),
	undef, "Creating a table.\n")
	or ErrMsgF("Cannot create table: Error %s.\n",
		   $dbh->errstr);


and finally, here's the place for you, the place where you enter
your tests:

    #
    #   and here's the right place for inserting new tests:
    #
    EDIT THIS!

There follows some stuff later, especially dropping the new
table, but in general leave this as it is.


Known problems
==============

mysql: The blob test fails with blobs larger than 252*256 bytes, you
       must start the mysql daemon with -Omax_allowed_packet=<bigvalue>.

msql: The null test fails, because the query

	SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = NULL

      doesn't return anything. Does anyone have an idea, how to modify
      this?

ODBC: ChopBlank test fail; seems to be a driver problem.


What remains to do?
===================

Writing test cases! For example I do currently not

  - check transactions (mysql doesn't know about transactions :-(

I'll be happy to include them into the test suite. Any new tests,
critics or suggestions welcome:
