[Details: https://github.com/mariuz/perl-dbd-firebird/commits/release0.90]
 * Always pass cleanup test and just warn on failure.
 * fix DBP_FILL_INTEGER
 * Note other authors in the AUTHORS section
 * drop inc/ from .gitignore
 * skip vim swap files
 * ignore *.bs and *.xsi regardless of the directory
 * move test routines in a package (TestFirebird)

  + rely on the ib_embedded dbh attribute for embedded detection
  + remove generated embedded tests on realclean
  + add test for the ib_embedded dbh attribute
  + print some info about libfbembed availability
  + support DBD_FIREBIRD_REQUIRE_EMBEDDED env. variable
 * create_test_database: set test database forced writes off
 * drop sleeping in ithreads test
 * drop use_libfbembed usage
 * diagnostics on database creation/drop
 * move decoding of status into ib_error_decode
 * implement DBD::Firebird->create_database
 * add DPB_FILL_STRING_LEN macro for when we know the length
 * use the driver instead of isql for creating the test database
 * implement DBD::Firebird->gfix
 * generic create_test_database

0.80 [2011-10-03]
[Details: https://github.com/mariuz/perl-dbd-firebird/commits/release0.80]
 * Reimplement bind_param_array without calling bind_param calling bind_param is not necessary as we ignore $attr anyway it also causes problems when the column has non-NULL constraint this makes bind_param_array work again. Fixes RT 54561
 * Append $Config{ccflags} to CCFLAGS This makes it possible for binary distributions to rebuild the module if perl's $Config{ccflags} is changed for whatever reason. Without this appending, binary compatibility can't be guaranteed. http://bugs.debian.org/643038
 * Fix test skipping in t/75-utf8t and t/dbi-rowcount.t
 * Add support for 'gnukfreebsd' platform This is the FreeBSD kernel with GNU userland. For our needs, this is identical
    to 'freebsd' and 'linux'.Closes Debian bug http://bugs.debian.org/643717
 * Define is_ascii_string for perls before 5.12.0 RC1 Fixes #23
 * Cleanup temp files at the end of tests.
 * Client only testing using the interactive test setup. Add host parameter to dns.
 * Simplified condition to test the DB path.

   records

  (experimental)

* $sth->rows() now returns the number of fetched rows, for SELECT, otherwise
  returns - 1 (unknown).

Aug 18 2000
* starting a transaction (automatic or not) is more robust, now it reuses an
  active transaction handle, instead of overridding it with a new one, leaving
  the previous one "immortal" (because the previous transaction handle is no
  longer kept!)

Aug 16 2000
* Fix $dbh->do() method for usage with placeholders.
* Added support for CursorName attrib
* more robust commit with AutoCommit on

Aug 13 2000
* Added datatype values conversion routine between InterBase internal
  values and DBI/ISO/ANSI/ODBC values
* Fixed tables() method, now correctly removes the trailing blank spaces
* Tested to 100% compliant with DBIx::Recordset (0.21)!

Aug 12 2000
* more informative error message
* fix ping() method. Now not die if RaiseError => 1

July 29 2000
* AutoCommit attribute handling:

- in dbd_login6():
simply turns on imp_dbh->init_commit = 1

- in db_STORE_attrib() :
if init_commit == 1:
if AutoCommit turned On: do nothing.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in
imp_dbh->tr

if init_commit == 0:
if AutoCommit turned On: commit changes.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in 
imp_dbh->tr

Before returning, init_commit is reset to 0.
