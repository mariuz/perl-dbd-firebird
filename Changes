 * add support for disabling database-level triggers (gh#53)
1.37 [2024-05-20]

 * fix a couple of compiler warnings
1.34 [2021-12-05]

   Debian/Ubuntu). Fixes RT#140139. Thanks to Slaven Rezić.
1.33 [2021-11-9]
 * Do not link with Firebird framework if it does not exist on macOS.
This should fix issue #51.
1.32 [2020-03-11]
 * Add support for COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements #48
1.31 [2017-12-05]
 * Re-release with all tests (some were missing in MANIFEST in 1.30)
1.30 [2017-12-05]
 * remove artificial hard-coded limit of 1_000_000 bytes when fetching BLOB
   data
1.29 [2017-12-02]
 * add /usr/local to the list of possible firebird homes [RT#123723]
 * blob_type needs to be signed to be assigned/compared to -1

   status vector for errors. An error there may be from a previous call,
   or just plain garbage

* starting a transaction (automatic or not) is more robust, now it reuses an
  active transaction handle, instead of overridding it with a new one, leaving
  the previous one "immortal" (because the previous transaction handle is no
  longer kept!)

* Fix $dbh->do() method for usage with placeholders.
* Added support for CursorName attrib
* more robust commit with AutoCommit on

Aug 13 2000
* Added datatype values conversion routine between InterBase internal

* AutoCommit attribute handling:

- in dbd_login6():
simply turns on imp_dbh->init_commit = 1

- in db_STORE_attrib() :
if init_commit == 1:
if AutoCommit turned On: do nothing.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in
imp_dbh->tr

if init_commit == 0:
if AutoCommit turned On: commit changes.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in 
imp_dbh->tr

Before returning, init_commit is reset to 0.
